    Calculates the object cobirth graph.
    This is calculated as follows:
     - Given the set of objects related to an event, they belong to two different categories:
        - The "seen" objects (they have appeared in some earlier event)
        - The "unseen" objects (they appear for the first time in the current event).
     - Every "unseen" object is connected to every "unseen" object

    Parameters
    -----------------
    ocel
        Object-centric event log
    parameters
        Parameters of the algorithm

    Returns
    ------------------
    object_cobirth_graph
        Object cobirth graph (undirected)
